# MLS_Intern_Case
For the project, you will be assuming the role of a GM for an MLS club. The trade deadline is quickly approaching and you must identify a position that you need to strengthen.  After identifying the position that needs strengthened, you must identify a maximum of 3 trade targets from inside the league that you feel would strengthen the position (due to cap constraints any acquired player must have a guaranteed compensation of under $400,000). In summary you must make the following decisions:

Which MLS team are you going to take control of?
Which position do you need to strengthen?
Which player would you try acquire in a trade (max of 3 targets)?
What would your trade proposal(s) be?
