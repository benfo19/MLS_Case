# MLS_Intern_Case
For the project, you will be assuming the role of a GM for an MLS club. The trade deadline is quickly approaching and you must identify a position that you need to strengthen.  After identifying the position that needs strengthened, you must identify a maximum of 3 trade targets from inside the league that you feel would strengthen the position (due to cap constraints any acquired player must have a guaranteed compensation of under $400,000). In summary you must make the following decisions:

Which MLS team are you going to take control of?
Which position do you need to strengthen?
Which player would you try acquire in a trade (max of 3 targets)?
(Optional) What would your trade proposal(s) be?
We would like you to provide us with:

1 data visualization to support your findings (preferably created in R)
Any code utilized in making your decisions (can provide GitHub link if applicable)
A writing sample (750 words or less) detailing:
·       Your selections

·       The process you used to make those selections

·       Information that was not made available to you that could have changed your perspective.

Please do not use any data outside of what can be found at American Soccer Analysis and MLS’s website.
